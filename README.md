# The Magic The Gathering collection application 

This project is made as my full stack development exam assignment.
and is a work in progress over the upcoming months.

## Background on Magic the gathering

Magic the gathering is a trading cart game that started early in the 90s.
in this game players can buy packs of cards that they then can try and combine into deck of cards.
this deck is made with the rules of the game in mind.
over time players will collect hundreds or thousands of cards.

## Why this tool.
This tool is made for the players to get a place where they can keep track on the cards the own
and build decks from it or look up cards that they may have intrest in.
